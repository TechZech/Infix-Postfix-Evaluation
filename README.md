# Infix-Postfix-Evaluation
Implementation of a generic stack container as an adaptor class template. Includes a program that converts infix expression to postfix expression as well as a program that evaluates postfix expressions using the stack container I developed.

The functions of my Stack class can be found in **stack.h** while the infix/postfix program can be found in **in2post.cpp**
